# plotting a world map with bioclimatic variables and elevation
## and projecting location of LHY haplotypes for Arabidopsis 1001 genome accessions

## Description
can be used to prepare a world map with a range of BioClim abiotic variables

Used to project LHY haplotype data onto various maps in James et al. 2018 Plant Cell & Environ 41(7): 1524-1538) 'Global spatial analysis of Arabidopsis natural variants implicates 5'UTR splicing of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL in responses to temperature.' e.g. Figure 5a, 5c and Suppl. Figure S6a.
